1. **Set Clear Objectives:**
   - Enhancing research on internal documents and data sources while maintaining confidentiality.
   - Identifying scope of information such as internal process documentation, business documentation, IT knowledge base
   - Creating an improved search engine prototype.

2. **Identify external AI resources that can help to achieve the project:**
   - data scientist,
   - AI engineer
   - AI researcher to assist in designing and implementing the solution.

3. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather data to train your language model.
   - Ensure compliance with company's confidentiality rules and handle sensitive data with care.

4. **Model Training:**
   - TensorFlow
   - PyTorch
   - A pre-trained models like GPT-3

5. **Evaluation:**
   - Assess its performance using relevant research metrics, such as precision and recall.
   - Make sure the model can understand and find relevant information.

6. **Prototyping:**
   - Create a prototype of your enhanced research solution using the language model.
   - Integrate it into a test environment to see how it performs in real conditions.

7. **Testing and Iteration:**
   - Solicit feedback from a group of internal testers or users to gather insights.
   - Use this feedback to improve the solution by iterating on the model.

8. **Security and Confidentiality:**
   - Ensure that confidential data remains secure by using appropriate security techniques such as encryption and access controls. - Comply with data protection regulations.

9. **Personnel Training:**
   - If your solution is complex to use, ensure your staff is trained to know how to use it effectively and securely.

10. **Deployment:**
    - When your solution is ready, deploy it in a production environment while maintaining security and confidentiality.

11. **Monitoring and Maintenance:**
    - Continuously monitor the performance of your solution and keep it updated to meet the evolving needs of your company.
