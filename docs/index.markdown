How to start a research project in artificial intelligence (AI) and using LLM language models :

![search bot](assets/images/searchbot.jpg){: width="25%" }

## Why

1. LLMs to enhance the search experience

2. Search to help fights knowledge loss

    In a recent survey of 1,000 IT managers at large enterprises, 67% said they were concerned by the loss of knowledge and expertise when people leave the company.

    Intelligent enterprise search prevents information islands and enables organizations to easily find, surface, and share information and their corporate knowledge of their best employees.

3. Search to solve application splintering and digital friction

    Employees today are drowning in tools. According to a recent study by Forrester, organizations use an average 367 different software tools, creating data silos and disrupting processes between teams. As a result, employees spend 25% of their time searching for information instead of focusing on their jobs.

    According to a recent Gartner survey, 44% of users made a wrong decision because they were unaware of information that could have helped, and 43% of users reported failing to notice important information because it got lost amid too many apps.

    Intelligent enterprise search unifies employees’ experiences so they can access all corporate knowledge seamlessly and accurately from a single interface

4. Search gets more relevant

    Fully one-third of employees report that they “never find” the information they’re looking for, always or most of the time.

    Advances in neural search capabilities incorporate LLM technology into deep neural networks: Models that incorporate context to provide excellent relevance through semantic search. Better yet, combining semantic and vector search approaches with statistical keyword search capabilities delivers relevance in a wide range of enterprise scenarios.

5. Question-answering methods get a neural boost

## How

1. **Set Clear Objectives:**
   - Enhancing research on internal documents and data sources while maintaining confidentiality.
   - Identifying scope of information such as internal process documentation, business documentation, IT knowledge base
   - Creating an improved search engine prototype.

2. **Identify external AI resources that can help to achieve the project:**
   - data scientist,
   - AI engineer
   - AI researcher to assist in designing and implementing the solution.

3. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather data to train your language model.
   - Ensure compliance with company's confidentiality rules and handle sensitive data with care.

4. **Model Training:**
   - TensorFlow
   - PyTorch
   - A pre-trained models like GPT-3
   - HuggingFace is an extensive library of both machine learning models and datasets that could be used for initial experiments.

5. **Evaluation:**
   - Assess its performance using relevant research metrics, such as precision and recall.
   - Make sure the model can understand and find relevant information.
   - Mandatory features of the model that are needed for your project
   - Available resources
   - Cost considerations

6. **Prototyping:**
   - Create a prototype of your enhanced research solution using the language model.
   - Integrate it into a test environment to see how it performs in real conditions.

7. **Testing and Iteration:**
   - Solicit feedback from a group of internal testers or users to gather insights.
   - Use this feedback to improve the solution by iterating on the model.
   - Pipeline dedicated to fine-tuning (Tools such as Charmed Kubeflow,  integrated with Charmed MLFlow)

8. **Security and Confidentiality:**
   - Ensure that confidential data remains secure by using appropriate security techniques such as encryption and access controls. - Comply with data protection regulations.

9. **Personnel Training:**
   - If your solution is complex to use, ensure your staff is trained to know how to use it effectively and securely.

10. **Deployment:**
    - When your solution is ready, deploy it in a production environment while maintaining security and confidentiality.

11. **Monitoring and Maintenance:**
    - Continuously monitor the performance of your solution and keep it updated to meet the evolving needs of your company.
