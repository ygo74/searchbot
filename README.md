## Context

Research within the enterprise plays a fundamental role in improving the work of employees. However, in the age of numerous information sources, this task has become complex. Finding the right information at the right time is a challenge that can hinder the productivity of our colleagues.

## Research Objective

This project aims to push the boundaries of enterprise research by harnessing the capabilities of artificial intelligence, particularly a Large Language Model (LLM). This innovative approach can revolutionize how we search for and access information within an enterprise.

## Expected Benefits

- **Quality Improvement:** By using an LLM language model, it is possible to make research smarter and more targeted, helping  colleagues to find relevant information more quickly.

- **Increased Productivity:** By facilitating access to the right information, it will increase employee productivity, freeing up their time for higher-value tasks.
